# Resume Chatbot

This is a Streamlit application that allows recruiters, interviewers, or anyone interested to ask questions about my resume. It provides an interactive way to get information from my resume by using a chatbot interface.

## Overview

The project consists of three main Python files:

-   `resume_reader.py`: This file sets up an agent that is responsible for reading and processing the resume.
-   `agents.py`: This file contains two agents:
    -   **Retrieval Agent**: This agent retrieves the relevant context from the resume based on the input question.
    -   **Reasoning Agent**: This agent takes the retrieved context and formulates an answer to the question using a prompt.
-   `app.py`: This is the main file that builds the Streamlit interface and orchestrates the interaction between the user and the agents.

## How It Works

1.  The `resume_reader.py` file initializes the resume reading agent, which is responsible for extracting and understanding the content of the resume.
2.  In `agents.py`, the Retrieval Agent identifies the most relevant sections of the resume in relation to the user's question. The Reasoning Agent then uses these sections to generate a comprehensive answer.
3.  The `app.py` file creates the Streamlit application, allowing users to input questions and receive answers generated by the agents.

## Usage

To use this application for your resume:

1.  Clone the repository.
2.  Ensure you have all the necessary dependencies installed (refer `requirements.txt`).
3.  Edit the `resume_path` in the `app.py` to your resume PDF.
4.  Run the `app.py` file using Streamlit: `streamlit run app.py`.
5.  Interact with the chatbot by asking questions related to the resume.

This project offers a convenient way to parse and understand the contents of my resume, providing an efficient tool for recruiters and anyone interested in learning about my qualifications and experience.
